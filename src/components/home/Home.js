                Turtle power!<br /><br />

                They're the world's most fearsome fighting team (We're really hip!)<br />
                They're heroes in a half-shell and they're green (Hey - get a grip!)<br />
                When the evil Shredder attacks<br />
                These Turtle boys don't cut him no slack!<br /><br />

                Splinter taught them to be ninja teens (He's a radical rat!)<br />
                Leonardo leads, Donatello does machines (That's a fact, Jack!)<br />
                Raphael is cool but crude (Gimme a break!)<br />
                Michaelangelo is a party dude (Party!)<br /><br />
